        <p>
          With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the
          spacing between elements, how element are positioned and laid out,
          what background images or background colors are to used, different
          displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
        </p>
      </div>
      <section>
        The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent elment will
        also apply to a children elements within the parent.So, if you set the
        color of the body text to blue, all headings, paragraphs, and other text
        element within the body will also get the same color(unless you specify
        something else)!
